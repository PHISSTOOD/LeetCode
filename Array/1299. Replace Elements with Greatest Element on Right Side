Given an array arr, replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to its right, 
and replace the last element with -1.
After doing so, return the array.

class Solution {
    public int[] replaceElements(int[] arr) {
        int max = -1;
        for(int i = arr.length-1;i>=0;i--){
            int temp = arr[i];
            arr[i] = max;
            if(temp>max){
                max = temp;
            }
        }
        return arr;
    }
}
