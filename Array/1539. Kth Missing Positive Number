Given an array arr of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer k.
Find the kth positive integer that is missing from this array.

class Solution {
    public int findKthPositive(int[] arr, int k) {
        int start=0;
		
        int end=arr.length-1;
		
        while(start<=end){
		
            int mid=start+(end-start)/2;
			
            if(arr[mid]-mid-1<k)start=mid+1;
			
            else end=mid-1;
        
		}
		
        return k+start;
    }
}
