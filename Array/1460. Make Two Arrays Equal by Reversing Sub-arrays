Given two integer arrays of equal length target and arr.
In one step, you can select any non-empty sub-array of arr and reverse it. You are allowed to make any number of steps.
Return True if you can make arr equal to target, or False otherwise.

Solution Description:
Using an array to record the occurence of each num and check is any number is not 0.

Code:
class Solution {
    public boolean canBeEqual(int[] target, int[] arr) {
        int[] map = new int[1001];
        for (int i : target) map[i]++;
        for (int i : arr) map[i]--;
        for (int i : map) if(i!=0) return false;          
        return true;
    }
}
