Given *n* non-negative integers *a1*, *a2*, ..., *an* , where each represents a point at coordinate (*i*, *ai*). *n* vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line *i* is at (*i*, *ai*) and (*i*, 0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.
