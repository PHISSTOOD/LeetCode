In MATLAB, there is a handy function called reshape which can reshape an m x n matrix into a new one with a different size r x c keeping its original data.

You are given an m x n matrix mat and two integers r and c representing the row number and column number of the wanted reshaped matrix.

The reshaped matrix should be filled with all the elements of the original matrix in the same row-traversing order as they were.

If the reshape operation with given parameters is possible and legal, output the new reshaped matrix; Otherwise, output the original matrix.

class Solution {
    public int[][] matrixReshape(int[][] mat, int r, int c) {
        int length = mat[0].length;
        if((r*c) != (length*mat.length)){
            return mat;
        }
        int[][] result = new int[r][c];
        for(int i = 0, n = 0; i<r; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j<c; j++){
                result[i][j] = mat[n/length][n%length];
                n++;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
