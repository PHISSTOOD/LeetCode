You are given an array nums of non-negative integers. 
nums is considered special if there exists a number x such that there are exactly x numbers in nums that are greater than or equal to x.
Notice that x does not have to be an element in nums.
Return x if the array is special, otherwise, return -1. It can be proven that if nums is special, the value for x is unique.

Solutio description:
If the number x fits the condition, there should exsits x numbers in nums greater than or equal to x. so, we just need to iterat from 1 to l, which means the length of the array.

class Solution {
    public int specialArray(int[] nums) {
        int length = nums.length;
        if(length<=0){
            return -1;
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        for(int i = length; i>=1;i--){
            if(length-i-1<0 && nums[length-i]>=i){
                return i;
            }else if(nums[length-i]>=i && nums[length-i-1]<i){
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
