Given an integer n. No-Zero integer is a positive integer which doesn't contain any 0 in its decimal representation.
Return a list of two integers [A, B] where:
A and B are No-Zero integers.
A + B = n
It's guarateed that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions you can return any of them.

class Solution {
    public int[] getNoZeroIntegers(int n) {
        int[] result = new int[2];
        for(int i = 1;i<=n/2;i++){
            if(!contains0(i)&&!contains0(n-i)){
                result[0] = i;
                result[1] = n-i;
                break;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    private boolean contains0(int n)
    {
        while(n>0)
        {
            if(n%10==0){
                return true;
            }
            n /= 10;
        }
        return false;
    }
}
