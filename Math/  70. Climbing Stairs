You are climbing a stair case. It takes n steps to reach to the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?
Note: Given n will be a positive integer.

class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if(n<=2)
        {
            return n;
        }
        int [] result  = new int [n+1];
        result[1]= 1;
        result[2]= 2;
        for(int i = 3;i<=n;i++)
        {
            result[i] = result[i-1]+result[i-2];
        }
        return result[n];
    }
}
