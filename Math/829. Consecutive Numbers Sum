Given a positive integer N, how many ways can we write it as a sum of consecutive positive integers?

class Solution {
    public int consecutiveNumbersSum(int N) {
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 1;;i++){
            int cur = N - (i*(i-1)/2);
            if(cur<=0){
                break;
            }else if(cur%i==0){
                result++;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}
