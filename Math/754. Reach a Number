You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a goal at position target.
On each move, you can either go left or right. During the n-th move (starting from 1), you take n steps.
Return the minimum number of steps required to reach the destination.

class Solution {
    public int reachNumber(int target) {
        target = Math.abs(target);
        int k = 0;
        while(target>0){
            target -= ++k;
        }
        return target%2==0 ? k : k+1+k%2;
    }
}
