Calculate the sum of two integers a and b, but you are not allowed to use the operator + and -.

class Solution {
    public int getSum(int a, int b) {
        int result = 0;
        int carry =  0;
        for(int i = 0;i<32;i++){
            int a1 = a&(1<<i);
            int b1 = b&(1<<i);
            result |= a1^b1^carry;
            carry = ((a1 & b1) | (b1 & carry) | (a1 & carry)) << 1;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
