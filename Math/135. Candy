There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.
You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

class Solution {
    public int candy(int[] ratings) {
        int[] candies = new int[ratings.length];
        Arrays.fill (candies,1);
        for(int i = 1;i<ratings.length;i++)
        {
            if(ratings[i]>ratings[i-1])
            {
                candies[i] = candies[i-1]+1;
            }
        }
        int result = candies[ratings.length-1];
        for(int i = ratings.length-2;i>=0;i--)
        {
            if(ratings[i]>ratings[i+1])
            {
                candies[i] = Math.max(candies[i+1]+1,candies[i]);
            }
            result += candies[i];
        }
        return result;
    }
}
