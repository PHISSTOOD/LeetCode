Given an array of integers that is already sorted in ascending order, 
find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.
The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, 
where index1 must be less than index2.
Note:
Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution and you may not use the same element twice.

class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int length = numbers.length;
        for(int i = 0,j = length-1;i<j;)
        {
            int sum = numbers[i]+ numbers[j];
            if(sum==target)
            {
                return new int[]{i+1,j+1};
            }else if(sum<target)
            {
                i++;
            }else
            {
                j--;
            }
        }
        return new int[]{0,0};
    }
}
