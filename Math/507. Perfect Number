A perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. 
A divisor of an integer x is an integer that can divide x evenly.
Given an integer n, return true if n is a perfect number, otherwise return false.

Solution description:
In this problem, we can iterate all numbers which is smaller than the squart of num.

Solution:
class Solution {
    public boolean checkPerfectNumber(int num) {
        if(num <= 1){
            return false;
        }
        int result = 0;
        for(int i = 1;i*i<num;i++){
            if(num % i == 0){
                result += i;
                result += num/i;
            }
        }
        return num == result-num;
    }
}
