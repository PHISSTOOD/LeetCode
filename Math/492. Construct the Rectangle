A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, 
your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.

class Solution {
    public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
        for(int i = (int)Math.sqrt(area); i>1; i--){
            if(area%i==0){
                return new int[]{Math.max(i,area/i),Math.min(i,area/i)};
            }
        }
        return new int[]{area,1};
    }
}
