The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted F(n) form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, 
starting from 0 and 1. That is,
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
Given n, calculate F(n).

Code:
class Solution {
    public int fib(int n) {
        int num1 = 0;
        int num2 = 1;
        for(int i = 2; i<=n; i++){
            if(i%2==0){
                num1 += num2;
            }else{
                num2 += num1;
            }
        }
        if(n%2==1){
            return num2;
        }else{
            return num1;
        }
    }
}
