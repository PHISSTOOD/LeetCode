Given a positive integer num, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Solution Description:


Code:
class Solution {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        int result = 0;
        int cur = 1;
        while(num>0){
            if(num%2==0){
                result += cur;
            }
            cur *= 2;
            num /= 2;       
        }
        return result;
    }
}
