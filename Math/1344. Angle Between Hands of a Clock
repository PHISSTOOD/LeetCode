Given two numbers, hour and minutes. Return the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the hour and the minute hand.

class Solution {
    public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        double hourHand = (double)(hour%12)*30+(double)minutes/60.0*30;
        double minuteHand = (double)minutes*6;
        double sum = Math.abs(minuteHand - hourHand);
        System.out.println(sum);
        if(sum>180.0){
            return 360.0-sum;
        }else{
            return sum;
        }
    }
}
