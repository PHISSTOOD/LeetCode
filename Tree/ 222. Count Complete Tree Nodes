Given a complete binary tree, count the number of nodes.
Note:
Definition of a complete binary tree from Wikipedia:
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, 
and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.



/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {
        if(root==null)
        return 0;
        if(root.left==null&&root.right==null)
        return 1;
        int left=countNodes(root.left);
        int right=countNodes(root.right);

        return left+right+1;
    }
}
