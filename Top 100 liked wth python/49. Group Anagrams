Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.
An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

class Solution:
    def groupAnagrams(self, strs: List[str]) -> List[List[str]]:
        dic = {}
        for s in strs:
            cur = "".join(sorted(s))
            if cur in dic:
                dic[cur].append(s)
            else:
                dic[cur] = [s]
        return list(dic.values())
