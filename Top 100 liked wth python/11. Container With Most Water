Given n non-negative integers a1, a2, ..., an , where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). 
n vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of the line i is at (i, ai) and (i, 0). 
Find two lines, which, together with the x-axis forms a container, such that the container contains the most water.

class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        left = 0
        right = len(height)-1
        result = 0
        while left < right:
            result = max(result,min(height[left],height[right])*(right-left))
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left += 1
            else:
                right -= 1
        return result
