You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

class Solution(object):
    def climbStairs(self, n):
        """
        :type n: int
        :rtype: int
        """
        steps = []
        steps.append(1)
        steps.append(2)
        while len(steps) < n:
            steps.append(steps[len(steps)-1]+steps[len(steps)-2])
        return steps[n-1]
