You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1.
If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

class Solution {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        char[] c1 = word1.toCharArray();
        char[] c2 = word2.toCharArray();
        int index1 = 0;
        int index2 = 0;
        while(index1 < word1.length() && index2<word2.length()){
            sb.append(c1[index1++]);
            sb.append(c2[index2++]);
        }
        if(index1<word1.length()){
            sb.append(word1.substring(index1));
        }
        if(index2<word2.length()){
            sb.append(word2.substring(index2));
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
